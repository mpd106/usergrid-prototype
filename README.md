usergrid
========

A tool for visualising usage data.

### goals

Extracting meaningful patterns from usage data is hard. Most of the standard services show a single user's timeline (pretty awesome), or line graphs of aggregated time-series (semi-helpful), but there's no consistent way to understand the full breadth and depth of the behaviour of a group of users in a specific timeframe.

This project is intended to:
- make high-level trends in user behaviour more apparent at a glance
- enable sorting and ordering of usage to surface interesting patterns
